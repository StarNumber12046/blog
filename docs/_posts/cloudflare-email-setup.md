## Introduction

When you have a domain and start thinking about what you can do with it, you may think of a private website, a blog or an email. If your TLD is .tk, .ml or just a "free" domain, creating an emailmay become difficult, here it's how to do it with Cloudflare and GMail.

## Getting started with forwarding

To get started register to Cloudflare and transfer your DNS (Domain Name System) to Cloudflare, then wait for the system to validate your new site.

1. Go to your site > Email and apply for beta.
2. Wait for an email to arrive and setup DNS (just go to email and do an automatic setup / add manually your records)
3. Setup your e-mail and verify the forwarding (click the link that arrives you)
4. Test by just sending an email to your newly created inbox, a mail from yourself will arrive to the mail address that you've chosen before.

## Setting up replies with GMail (alias)
